    <h2>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries
         to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.It has been a 
         part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was 
         introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at
          the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.</h2>

<h2>The complete set of rules is extensive,but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of 
        the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a 
        hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the  team's 
        court.The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch
         the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players
          may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3] Typically, the first two touches are used to set up 
          for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the 
          team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. 
          The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally</h2> 

<h2>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, physical director of the Young Men’s Christian 
    Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was designed as an indoor sport for businessmen who 
    found the new game of basketball too vigorous. Morgan called the sport “mintonette,” until a 
     from Springfield College in Massachusetts noted the volleying nature of play and proposed the name of
    “volleyball.” The original rules were written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the Official
    Handbook of the Athletic League of the Young Men’s Christian Associations of North America (1897). The 
     game soon proved to have wide appeal for both sexes in schools, playgrounds, the armed forces, and 
    other organizations in the United States, and it was subsequently introduced to other countries.</h2>

<h2>History has it that William G. Morgan, who invented the game of volleyball in 1895, came up with the idea
     so that people who found basketball’s ‘bumping’ or ‘jolting’ too strenuous could have an alternative 
     physical activity to fall back on.</h2>

<h2>Volleyball requires a minimum of equipment and space and can be played indoors or outdoors. The game is
     played on a smooth-surfaced court 9 meters (30 feet) wide by 18 meters (60 feet) long, divided by a 
     center line into two equal areas, one of which is selected by or assigned to each of the two competing 
     teams. Players may not step completely beyond the center line while the ball is in play. A line 3 meters 
     (10 feet) from and parallel to the center line of each half of the court indicates the point in front of
      which a back court player may not drive the ball over the net from a position above the top of the net.
    This offensive action, called a spike, or kill, is usually performed most effectively and with greatest 
    power near the net by the forward line of players.

   A tightly stretched net is placed across the court exactly above the middle of the center line; official
     net heights (measured from the top edge of the net to the playing surface—in the middle of the court) are
      2.4 meters (8 feet) for men and 2.2 meters (7.4 feet) for women. Further adjustments in net height can 
      be made for young people and others who need a lower net. A vertical tape marker is attached to the net 
      directly above each side boundary line of the court, and, to help game officials judge whether served or
       volleyed balls are in or out of bounds, a flexible antenna extends 1 meter (3 feet) above the net along
        the outer edge of each vertical tape marker.
    
   The ball used is around 260 to 280 grams (9 to 10 ounces) and is inflated to about 65 cm (25.6 inches) in 
   circumference. A ball must pass over the net entirely between the antennae. A service area,traditionally 3 
   meters (10 feet) long, is marked outside and behind the right one-third of each court endline. At the 1996
    Olympic Games the service area was extended to 9 meters (30 feet). The service must be made from within or
     behind this area. A space at least 2 meters (6 feet) wide around the entire court is needed to permit 
     freedom of action, eliminate hazards from obstructions, and allow space for net support posts and the 
     officials’ stands. A clear area above the court at least 8 meters (26 feet) high is required to permit
      the ball to be served or received and played without interference.</h2>

      <h2>Informally, any number can play volleyball. In competition each team consists of six players, three of whom take the forward positions in a row close to and facing the net, the other three playing the back court. (An exception to this rotation is the libero, a position introduced at the 2000 Olympics; see below.) Play is started when the right back (the person on the right of the second row) of the serving team steps outside the end line into the serving area and bats the ball with a hand, fist, or arm over the net into the opponents’ half of the court. The opponents receive the ball and return it across the net in a series of not more than three contacts with the ball. This must be done without any player catching or holding the ball while it is in play and without any player touching the net or entering the opponents’ court area. The ball must not touch the floor, and a player may not touch the ball twice in succession. A player continues to serve until that player’s team makes an error, commits a foul, or completes the game. When the service changes, the receiving team becomes the serving team and its players rotate clockwise one position, the right forward shifting to the right back position and then serving from the service area. Either team can score, with points being awarded for successfully hitting the ball onto the opposing side’s half of the court, as well as when the opposing side commits errors or fouls, such as hitting the ball out of bounds, failing to return the ball, contacting the ball more than three times before returning it, etc. Only one point at a time is scored for a successful play. A game is won by the team that first scores 25 points, provided the winning team is ahead by 2 or more points, except in the fifth set, when a team needs to score only 15 points and win by 2 points.</h2>
